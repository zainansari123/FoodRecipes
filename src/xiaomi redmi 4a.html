<p>We spent some time with the Xiaomi Redmi 4A recently, including unboxing the retail box.
 You can check out our first look of the smartphone below.</p>

<p>The Xiaomi Redmi 4A unit we received came in a neat white box with just '4A' written on top of it. The retail box of the smartphone also sports 'Made in India; tag. We liked the small minimalist packaging, and checking contents of the box, we see that it comes with a handset and includes standard documentation. The device comes with bundled charging adapter, and Micro-USB data cable. Xiaomi has once again not bundled earphones in the box which could be disheartening but not altogether surprising for customers in this price category.</p>
<p>Thanks to the 5-inch screen size, the Xiaomi Redmi 4A fits in one hand perfectly. The Redmi 4A runs on MIUI 8 based on Android 6.0 Marshmallow, and the interface is same as we have seen in other Redmi devices.</p>
<p>For specifications, the Redmi 4A is powered by a 1.4GHz quad-core Snapdragon 425 processor coupled with 2GB of RAM. It bears a hybrid dual-SIM card slot which means you have to choose between using two SIM cards or a SIM card with a microSD card.</p>
<p>In terms of camera, the Redmi 4A sports a 13-megapixel rear camera with PDAF, a 5-lens system, and an f/2.2 aperture, while the front packs a 5-megapixel sensor with an f/2.2 aperture. It bears 16GB of inbuilt storage that is expandable via microSD card (up to 128GB). The handset supports 4G VoLTE apart from Wi-Fi, GPS, and Bluetooth. Sensors on board the Redmi 4A include accelerometer, ambient light, gyroscope, infrared, and proximity. The smartphone is powered by a 3120mAh battery with fast charging support.</p>
